# CSS Coding Conventions

## Introduction 
This document is written to capture the conventions of writing styles for our projects. Many of the rules will be or are part of our linter and prettier settings. Due to variety of our projects and methods there might be a need for a more detailed approach per situation. This might also impact how code is being organized, structured on an architectonic level. Therefore, this part of the conventions will focus on the rules that are applicable to the majority of our implementation methods.

## Disclaimer
It's important to note that client and project requirements always undo choices made in these guidelines

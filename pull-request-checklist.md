# Frontend Pull Request reviewer checklist

- [x] It follows the MediaMonks
      [frontend coding standards](https://github.com/mediamonks/frontend-coding-standards) (proper
      naming for variables, functions, properties, booleans, etc.)
- [x] Does the title follow the correct structure?
- [x] Does the PR correctly solve the issue or implement the feature?
- [x] Is there a clear description of what this PR adds/changes/fixes?
- [x] Has a linked issue
- [x] Pipeline or build doesn't fail
- [x] Are the files in the right directory?
- [x] Is there any commented code that should be removed?
- [x] Are all comments resolved by either a check or a closing statement?
- [x] If a util or global molecule or atom has been changed does it affect other areas?
- [x] If there are additions to package.json dependencies, check if they are really necessary and
      how they affect the bundle size.
- [x] Check for unintended code duplication (have utilities or components been added of which
      similar versions already exist in the codebase?)
- [x] If the code in the PR is only part of a feature instead of a complete feature: is the part
      useful by itself?
- [x] Are you using any? There are a couple of valid use cases, but in a lot of cases unknown is
      better.
- [x] Would it break if data is unavailable?
- [x] For abstractions: abstractions are often a trade-off between maintainability (DRY) and
      readability (DAMP). Is this abstraction worth the trade-off?
- [x] Is code understandable enough when reviewed, or does it need some code comments to explain the
      intent or behaviour.
- [x] Is code in the PR already present in a similar or relatable way somewhere else in the
      codebase, and can it be merged/copied/refactored?
- [x] Can the code in the PR be written more generically to be more usable at a later time?
- [x] Is code in the PR already available as an NPM module (already tested, well used, documented)?
- [x] Are all TODO comments ticketed up, with a ticket link appended to the TODO comment?
- [x] Does the feature need any documentation outside of the code/PR (e.g. confluence)?
